📊 Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

Forage – Quantium (Retail Analytics & Strategy)

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my completed work from the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program offered by Forage.
The simulation replicates real-world tasks a data analyst might perform in a retail analytics team — analyzing customer transaction data to uncover business insights, performing controlled experimentation, and preparing data-driven recommendations for a client. 
GitHub

The project is structured around three core tasks that cover the full data analytics lifecycle:

Data preparation & customer analytics

Experimentation & uplift testing

Analytics & commercial reporting

🛠 Tools & Technologies

I used a mix of analytical and reporting tools, including:
✔ Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn) or R (tidyverse, ggplot2) — depending on your approach
✔ Jupyter Notebooks / RStudio
✔ Excel for quick exploration and checks
✔ PowerPoint / PDF for client reporting

📍 Task 1 — Data Preparation & Customer Analytics

Goal: Understand customer purchasing behavior and identify meaningful customer segments.
✔ Loaded customer & transaction datasets and cleaned the data.
✔ Converted dates, removed inconsistencies and outliers.
✔ Explored customer segmentation (LIFESTAGE / PREMIUM_CUSTOMER).
✔ Created key metrics to quantify purchasing behavior and trends.
✔ Developed visuals to support insights. 
GitHub

Key Insights:

Majority of sales came from specific customer segments (e.g., Mainstream-Young Singles/Couples).

Significant purchase drivers identified by analyzing spend, frequency, and segment.

📍 Task 2 — Experimentation & Uplift Testing

Goal: Identify control stores to compare against trial stores and measure impact.
✔ Calculated measures (e.g., Pearson correlation, magnitude distance) to match trial stores with suitable controls.
✔ Compared sales and customer metrics between trial and control pairs.
✔ Tested significance of performance differences over the trial period. 
GitHub

Key Outcomes:

Determined which control stores best matched each trial store based on data similarity.

Evaluated uplift in sales performance for trial stores.

📍 Task 3 — Analytics & Commercial Reporting

Goal: Translate findings into actionable insights and business recommendations.
✔ Created a client-ready report using the Pyramid Principle.
✔ Included visuals, insights, and strategic recommendations.
✔ Focused on clarity and commercial impact to support decision-making. 
GitHub

Report Highlights:

Clear problem statement and context

Supporting charts & visuals

Insight summaries with business implications

Strategic recommendations for the client segment
